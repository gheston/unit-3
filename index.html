        <h1>Nevada 2022 General Election Results</h1>
        <h3>Nevada is a Swing State but with a sharp divde between urban and rural voters, and a rising influence of
            nonpartisan voters.</h3>

    <div class="narrative">
        <p>Results in Nevada's 2022 election were closely divided between the Democratic and Republican Governor and
            Senate candidates.</p>

        <p>A new Nevada law effective in 202 allows new residents automatically get registered to vote when they register their
            vehicles at the DMV. More than 140,000 new voters were registered in the program's first year.</p>

        <p>Nevada's population is not evenly distributed across the state. 71% of the state's voters live in Clark
            County (metropolitan Las Vegas). 17% live in Washoe County (metropolitan Reno). The remaining 12% live in
            Nevada's 15 rural counties (including Carson City, the state capital).</p>

        <p>Statewide, Democrats are in the lead at 32.5%, with Republicans at 29.8%. There is a stark divide in party
            registration between the urban and rural areas. In Clark County, Democrats have a nearly 10-point advantage
            over Republicans. Washoe County, the state's "swing" county, Republicans have a less than 2-point advantage
            over Democrats. However, in the Rural counties, collectively, Republicans have a 30-point advantage over
            Democrats, with Carson City being the most urbanized and "purple". Third party voters are relatively even
            across the state at 7.6%. The real story in recent years is the growth of registered voters not affiliated
            with any political party: 30.1% statewide, in second place to Democrats and leading Republicans. This has
            led to the major parties agressively courting independent voters during election cycles and creating tossup
            elections because of the great unknown.</p>

        <p>Nonpartisan voters can't vote in primary elections in Nevada, so primary candidates only need to appeal to
            their own party bases. This leads to general election candidates that are extremely partisan and don't
            appeal to a wide range of voters, and therefore results in low voter turnout. A state constitutional
            amendment to allow nonpartisan voters to participate in primary elections passed an initial vote in 2022.
        </p>

        <h2>Governor's Race</h2>

        <p>In the Governor's race, Governor Sisolak (DEM) was unpopular because of the state's COVID-19 restrictions,
            high unemployment (especially in Las Vegas), and high gas prices. Despite winning both urban counties by
            narrow margins, he wasn't able to overcome the "rural Republican firewall", and he lost to his Republican
            opponent, Clark County Sherriff Joe Lombardo by just 15,386 votes, or 1.5%.</p>

        <h2>Senate Race</h2>

        <p>The Senate race was also highly competitive. The incumbent, first-term Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (DEM)
            faced former Attorney General Adam Laxalt (REP). Unlike Lombardo, Laxalt didn't overcome the rural
            firewall and lost to Cortez-Masto by 7,928 votes (0.8%). The performance difference can probably be chalked
            up to Lombardo being overall a better candidate than Laxalt. Also, despite the uneven geographic
            distribution of party voters, overall Nevada is still a swing state and highly competitive.</p>

        <p>Nevada's other senator, Jackie Rosen, is a Democrat and will be up for election in 2024.</p>

        <h2>Congress</h2>
        <p>Nevada has four Representatives to Congress: 3 Democrats (from the Las Vegas area and southern Rural
            counties) and 1 Republican (Reno and the northern Rural counties.)</p>

        <h2>State Assembly</h2>
        <p>Nevada's legislature is firmly in the hands of Democrats: Democrats control the Assembly 28 to 14 and the
            Senate 13 to 8. All the Democratic seats are in the state's urban areas.</p>

        <h2>Statewide offices</h2>

        <p>Of the five statewide constitutional officers, two are Republican (Lieutenant Governor and Controller), and
            three are Democrat (Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Treasurer). Each of these offices had
            competitive races, with the most extreme Republican candidates losing to the Democrats.</p>
